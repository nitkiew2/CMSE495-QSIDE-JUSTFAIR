  - Analyze variations from state-to-state between judicial districts.
  - Answer questions such as: How is the data organized? How do we make this data more efficient for future researchers?  How do we display data in lamens terms? Are       people being sentenced at higher or lower rates? Are Judges sentencing at irregular rates compared to the standard average rate?
  - Create/Expand on future work ideas that can add to the Python package's capabilities
